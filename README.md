# What is this?

This is a Java-based implementation of a network stack for educational purposes. It is inspired from the book by Kurose/Ross: 'Computer Networking: a top-down approach'. The library contained in this project was used as a tutorial in the Computer Neworks lecture at the Institute of Distributed Systems at University of Ulm, Germany.

# Usage

The library was used for a full semester tutorial (12 weeks). The tutorial started with implementing a simple echo server on top of the libary. Then, layer-by-layer was removed and had to be implemented by the students down to a network layer that supports lossy transmission of files. Each of the layers to be implemented formed an excercise.

# File Structure

The directories contained herein are organised as follows:
* src contains the source code
* bin contains several eclipse launcer configurations to run example server and client applications and a registry
* doc contains the Javadocs for the library
* export contains configuration files to prepare the jar files for the individual exercises.
